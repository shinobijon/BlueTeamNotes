## Executive Summary

The Executive Summary serves as an accessible entry point for a wide audience, including non-technical stakeholders. This section provides a concise overview, key findings, immediate actions taken, and the impact on stakeholders. Many stakeholders may only read this section, so clarity is essential.

| **Stakeholder Impact** | Evaluate impact on customers, employees, proprietary information, and potential financial repercussions.                                                              |

## Technical Analysis

In-depth breakdown of the technical events during the incident. This section should cover:

### Affected Systems & Data
- List all compromised or potentially accessed systems and data. If data was exfiltrated, specify the amount.

### Evidence Sources & Analysis
- Include all evidence analyzed and methodology (e.g., web access logs). Emphasize evidence integrity with hashes where necessary.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Provide IoCs (e.g., unusual processes, outbound traffic) for threat hunting or attribution to specific threat actors.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities exploited, root causes, and failure points.

### Technical Timeline
Document key events, including:
  - Reconnaissance
  - Initial Compromise
  - C2 Communications
  - Enumeration, Lateral Movement
  - Data Access & Exfiltration
  - Malware Deployment (Process Injection, Persistence)
  - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery times

### Nature of the Attack
- Explanation of the attack type, TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by the attacker.

## Impact Analysis

Assess the adverse effects on data, operations, and reputation. This includes quantifying and qualifying damage, business implications (e.g., financial losses), regulatory penalties, and reputational impacts.

## Response and Recovery Analysis

### Immediate Response Actions

#### Revocation of Access
  - **Compromised Accounts/Systems Identified:** Account of tools and methodology used to identify compromised entities.
  - **Timeframe:** Precise timestamp of detection and revocation.
  - **Method of Revocation:** Explanation of revocation methods (e.g., disabling accounts, altering firewall rules).
  - **Impact:** Prevented further compromise or exfiltration.

#### Containment Strategy
  - **Short-term Containment:** Isolation of affected systems from the network.
  - **Long-term Containment:** Strategic measures like segmentation or zero-trust implementation.
  - **Effectiveness:** Evaluation of containment measures.

### Eradication Measures

#### Malware Removal
  - **Identification:** Procedures used to detect malware, including EDR tools or forensic analysis.
  - **Removal Techniques:** Specific tools or manual methods used.
  - **Verification:** Steps to ensure complete removal, such as checksum verification.

#### System Patching
  - **Vulnerability Identification:** Discovery methods for vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs).
  - **Patch Management:** Steps for testing, deployment, and verification of patches.
  - **Fallback Procedures:** Reversion procedures in case of instability.

### Recovery Steps

#### Data Restoration
  - **Backup Validation:** Procedures to confirm backup integrity.
  - **Restoration Process:** Detailed steps for data recovery.
  - **Data Integrity Checks:** Verification of restored data accuracy.

#### System Validation
  - **Security Measures:** Ensuring system security through reconfiguration or IDS updates.
  - **Operational Checks:** Verifying that systems operate as expected.

## Post-Incident Actions

### Monitoring
  - **Enhanced Monitoring Plans:** Detailed plans for future monitoring to detect similar vulnerabilities.
  - **Tools and Technologies:** Specific tools integrated into the monitoring strategy.

### Lessons Learned
  - **Gap Analysis:** Evaluation of failed security measures.
  - **Recommendations for Improvement:** Actionable steps for strengthening defenses.
  - **Future Strategy:** Long-term policy, architectural, or training changes.

## Diagrams

Use visuals to simplify the incident's complexities:
  - **Incident Flowchart:** Progression of the attack from entry point to network propagation.
  - **Affected Systems Map:** Network topology highlighting compromised nodes.
  - **Attack Vector Diagram:** Diagram of the attacker's movement and exploitation path.

## Appendices

Provides additional context, evidence, or technical details. This section serves as the backbone for verification and adds depth to the main report narrative.

Contents might include:
  - Log Files
  - Network Diagrams (pre- and post-incident)
  - Forensic Evidence (disk images, memory dumps)
  - Code snippets
  - Incident Response Checklist
  - Communication Records
  - Compliance Documentation (NDAs, regulatory forms)
  - Glossary and Acronyms

## Best Practices

  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the root cause to prevent recurrence.
  - **Community Sharing:** Share non-sensitive insights with the security community.
  - **Regular Updates:** Keep stakeholders informed throughout the incident response.
  - **External Review:** Engage third-party experts to validate findings.

## Conclusion

An incident report is essential following a security event, providing a thorough analysis of what went wrong, effective responses, and strategies to prevent similar events in the future.
