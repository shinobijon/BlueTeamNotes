| **Task #1: Open PCAP**       | Open a pre-captured file to analyze HTTP traffic.                                                                                                                                                                         | 1. **Open Wireshark.** <br> 2. Select **File → Open** and browse to `Wireshark-lab-2.pcap`. <br> 3. Open the file to display all traffic in the capture.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Task #2: Filter HTTP Traffic** | Apply a filter to focus only on HTTP (port 80) traffic, helping identify HTTP requests and responses, especially `200 OK` responses indicating file transfers.                                                              | 1. In the **Display Filter** toolbar, type `http`. <br> 2. Ensure the filter bar lights up green, indicating correct syntax. <br> 3. Review the HTTP traffic, looking for `GET` requests and `200 OK` responses. This shows files being requested and successfully sent.                                          |
| **Task #3: Follow TCP Stream**  | Select an HTTP packet with `200 OK` and follow the stream to verify the data transfer.                                                                                                                                       | 1. Choose an HTTP packet with `200 OK` in the **Info** field. <br> 2. **Right-click** and select **Follow → TCP Stream**. <br> 3. A new window shows the full stream; Wireshark automatically applies `tcp.stream eq #` to filter that conversation. Validate that the file transfer happened in this stream.    |
| **Task #4: Filter for JFIF Images** | Check for JPEG images in the HTTP traffic by filtering for JFIF format, commonly used in JPEG images, to locate any embedded image files in the data transfer. | 1. Clear previous filters. <br> 2. Type `http && image-jfif` in the **Display Filter** toolbar to focus on HTTP packets with JFIF content. <br> 3. This filter should reveal only packets containing JPEG image files, simplifying the view to a few relevant packets.                                           |
| **Task #5: Export Images**       | Export the identified image files from the HTTP traffic for further examination.                                                                                                                                           | 1. Select **File → Export Objects → HTTP**. <br> 2. Locate and save the relevant image file(s) (e.g., `file.JPG`). <br> 3. Save the file locally to complete the extraction. These images can now be reviewed for any hidden or suspicious data requested by the security manager.                                   |
