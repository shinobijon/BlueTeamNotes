| **Connect to Live Host**            | Connect to the Academy lab environment using XfreeRDP for GUI access to Wireshark.                                | `xfreerdp /v:<target IP> /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`                                                    |
| **Start Capture on Interface**      | Begin capturing on interface ENS224 in Wireshark.                                                                 | Open Wireshark, select interface ENS224, and start capture.                                                       |
| **Define the Issue**                | Briefly summarize the issue based on baseline anomalies noticed by admin with IP 172.16.10.90.                    | Issue: Suspicious activity from IP 172.16.10.90                                                                   |
| **Define Scope and Goal**           | Scope: Investigate unusual traffic patterns around host IP 172.16.10.90.                                          | Scope: Check for suspicious connections, identify host actions, focus on the specific time anomaly was observed.  |
| **Define Target Hosts and Network** | Define specific network addresses and protocols for focus in analysis.                                            | Target Host: 172.16.10.90 <br> Protocols: TCP, RDP                                                                |
| **Capture or Analyze Traffic**      | Perform network capture or analyze PCAP for signs of intrusion.                                                   | **Read from PCAP (if available):** `tcpdump -r guided-analysis.zip`                                               |
| **Filter for Relevant Traffic**     | Filter out baseline traffic and focus on anything unusual from 172.16.10.90 or uncommon protocols/ports.          | **Filter for Host:** `tcpdump -r guided-analysis.zip host 172.16.10.90`                                           |
| **Analyze Captured Traffic**        | Dig through filtered data to find suspicious patterns, commands, or sessions (e.g., unusual ports, RDP sessions). | **Look for RDP/Netcat Indicators:** e.g., TCP port 3389, Netcat indicators                                        |
| **Note Taking and Mapping**         | Log all findings: Timeframes, hosts, ports, conversations, and specific packet numbers or files of interest.      | Document packet numbers, suspicious IPs, timestamps, protocols, and any noted commands or sessions.               |
| **Summarize Analysis**              | Summarize findings, detailing any malicious activity, including tools (e.g., Netcat, RDP attempts).               | **Summary:** Actor utilized Netcat and RDP on Bobâ€™s host; IR response recommended to quarantine compromised host. |
