In traffic analysis, it's critical to scrutinize link-layer protocols. 802.11 (Wi-Fi) attacks, while sometimes overlooked, require continuous monitoring due to potential human errors that might compromise perimeter security.

## Capturing 802.11 Traffic

To analyze 802.11 raw traffic, a wireless interface in **monitor mode** is required. This enables visibility into raw 802.11 frames, similar to promiscuous mode.

- **Enumerate Wireless Interfaces** (Linux):
  `iwconfig`
  
- **Enable Monitor Mode** (Option 1: `airmon-ng`):
  ```bash
  sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
  ```
  
- **Enable Monitor Mode** (Option 2: System utilities):
  ```bash
  sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
  sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
  sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
  ```
  
- **Verify Monitor Mode**:
  ```bash
  iwconfig
  ```

To capture traffic, specify the AP's channel (`-c`), BSSID (`--bssid`), and output file (`-w`) with `airodump-ng`:
```bash
sudo airodump-ng -c 4 --bssid F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1 wlan0 -w raw
```

## How Deauthentication Attacks Work

Deauthentication/dissociation attacks are common link-layer attacks, often used to:
- Capture WPA handshakes
- Disrupt service
- Force users to connect to malicious networks

Attackers typically spoof 802.11 deauthentication frames from the legitimate AP, tricking clients into disconnecting. Tools like `aireplay-ng` and `mdk4` often use **reason code 7** for deauthentication.

### Detecting Deauthentication Attacks

Open `deauthandbadauth.cap` in Wireshark to inspect traffic from the AP's BSSID:
- **Wireshark Filter** (for APâ€™s BSSID):
  ```plaintext
  wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
  ```

- **Filter for Deauthentication Frames**:
  ```plaintext
  (wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12)
  ```

If excessive deauthentication frames appear, this suggests an attack. **Reason Code 7** is often used by common attack tools. To filter for this:
```plaintext
(wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 7)
```

### Revolving Reason Codes

Sophisticated attackers may vary reason codes to avoid detection:
- **Filter for Reason Code 1**:
  ```plaintext
  (wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 1)
  ```

- **Filter for Reason Code 2**:
  ```plaintext
  (wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 2)
  ```

## Compensating Measures

To prevent deauthentication attacks:
- Enable **IEEE 802.11w** (Management Frame Protection)
- Use **WPA3-SAE**
- Update **WIDS/WIPS** detection rules

## Detecting Failed Authentication Attempts

Excessive association requests can indicate an attack. Filter in Wireshark to capture these:
```plaintext
(wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 11)
```
