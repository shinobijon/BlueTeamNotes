DNS traffic analysis can be challenging due to its high volume, but identifying abnormalities is crucial for detecting malicious activity.

## DNS Queries

DNS queries allow clients to resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.

### DNS Forward Queries

In a forward lookup, the client resolves a domain name to an IP address, following these steps:

1. **Query Initiation**: Client queries domain, e.g., `academy.hackthebox.com`.
2. **Local Cache Check**: Checks local DNS cache; if unresolved, continues.
3. **Recursive Query**: Sends query to the configured DNS server.
4. **Root Servers**: DNS resolver queries root servers if necessary.
5. **TLD Servers**: Root server directs to TLD servers (e.g., `.com`).
6. **Authoritative Servers**: TLD server points to domain's authoritative server.
7. **Domainâ€™s Authoritative Servers**: The resolver obtains the IP address.
8. **Response**: The IP address is sent back to the client.

### DNS Reverse Lookups/Queries

Reverse lookups are used to find a domain name from an IP address:

1. **Query Initiation**: Client sends a DNS reverse query with the IP.
2. **Reverse Lookup Zones**: DNS resolver checks if it is authoritative.
3. **PTR Record Query**: Resolver searches for a PTR record.
4. **Response**: The FQDN is returned if a matching PTR is found.

## DNS Record Types

| Record Type | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| A           | Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address            |
| AAAA        | Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address            |
| CNAME       | Creates an alias for a domain                    |
| MX          | Specifies mail server for the domain             |
| NS          | Authoritative name servers for the domain        |
| PTR         | Used in reverse queries to map IP to a domain    |
| TXT         | Specifies text associated with the domain        |
| SOA         | Administrative information about the zone        |

## Detecting DNS Enumeration Attempts

A high volume of DNS queries from a single host may suggest DNS enumeration. Using Wireshark, filter DNS traffic as follows:

```plaintext
dns
```

If queries include `ANY`, this could indicate DNS enumeration, or even subdomain enumeration.

## Finding DNS Tunneling

DNS tunneling can involve a significant number of **TXT records** from one host. Attackers may exfiltrate data by appending it to the TXT field of DNS queries.

### Example of DNS Tunneling Indicators

Examine DNS traffic for unusual or unexpected text in the TXT field. Encoded or encrypted data may appear, often as base64:

1. **Extracting Base64 Encoded Data**:
   ```bash
   echo 'VTBaU1EyVXhaSFprVjNocldETnNkbVJXT1cxaU0wb3pXVmhLYTFneU1XeFlNMUp2WVZoT1ptTklTbXhrU0ZJMVdETkNjMXBYUm5wYQpXREJMQ2c9PQo=' | base64 -d
   ```

2. **Handling Multi-Level Encoding**:
   ```bash
   echo 'encoded_string' | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d
   ```

   Some attackers may encode data multiple times or encrypt it, making detection harder.

## Reasons for DNS Tunneling

1. **Data Exfiltration**: Used to covertly export data from a network.
2. **Command and Control**: Enables compromised systems to communicate with attacker-controlled servers, often used in botnets.
3. **Firewall Bypassing**: DNS tunnels can bypass firewalls or proxies focused on HTTP/HTTPS.
4. **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)**: Advanced malware uses DGAs to generate dynamic domain names, complicating detection.

## The Interplanetary File System and DNS Tunneling

Advanced threat actors may use IPFS to store and retrieve malicious files, making DNS/HTTP traffic to URIs like the following noteworthy:

- **IPFS Example URI**:
  ```
  https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmS6eyoGjENZTMxM7UdqBk6Z3U3TZPAVeJXdgp9VK4o1Sz
  ```

IPFS operates on a peer-to-peer basis, complicating detection. Regular monitoring of DNS and HTTP/HTTPS traffic is essential to mitigate these attacks.
