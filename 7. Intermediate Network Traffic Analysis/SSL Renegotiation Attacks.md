While analyzing encrypted HTTPS traffic, it's essential to understand HTTPS protocol indicators that may reveal SSL/TLS-based attacks. HTTPS relies on encryption protocols, specifically:

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**

## HTTPS Connection Process

1. **Handshake**: Server and client establish a connection, agreeing on encryption algorithms and exchanging certificates.
2. **Encryption**: Following the handshake, the connection is encrypted with the selected algorithm.
3. **Data Exchange**: Encrypted data (web pages, images, etc.) is exchanged between client and server.
4. **Decryption**: Both sides decrypt data using their private and public keys.

### SSL Renegotiation Attack

SSL renegotiation attacks attempt to negotiate lower encryption standards or exploit server resources, causing potential vulnerabilities. Another example of HTTPS encryption attacks includes the **Heartbleed Vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160)**.

## TLS and SSL Handshake Process

To secure a connection, a TLS or SSL handshake is required, involving:

1. **Client Hello**: Client sends supported TLS/SSL versions, cipher suites, and random data.
2. **Server Hello**: Server responds with its chosen version, cipher suite, and a nonce.
3. **Certificate Exchange**: Server sends its certificate containing the public key.
4. **Key Exchange**: Client generates a premaster secret, encrypts it with the serverâ€™s public key, and sends it to the server.
5. **Session Key Derivation**: Both parties derive session keys using exchanged nonces and the premaster secret.
6. **Finished Messages**: Both parties exchange finished messages, confirming successful handshake.
7. **Secure Data Exchange**: The encrypted communication begins.

### TLS Handshake Algorithmic Breakdown

| Handshake Step          | Relevant Calculations                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Client Hello            | `ClientHello = { ClientVersion, ClientRandom, Ciphersuites, CompressionMethods }`                     |
| Server Hello            | `ServerHello = { ServerVersion, ServerRandom, Ciphersuite, CompressionMethod }`                       |
| Certificate Exchange    | `ServerCertificate = { ServerPublicCertificate }`                                                      |
| Key Exchange            | `ClientDHPublicKey = DH_KeyGeneration(ClientDHPrivateKey)`<br> `ServerDHPublicKey = DH_KeyGeneration(ServerDHPrivateKey)` |
| Premaster Secret        | `PremasterSecret = DH_KeyAgreement(ServerDHPublicKey, ClientDHPrivateKey)`                             |
| Session Key Derivation  | `MasterSecret = PRF(PremasterSecret, "master secret", ClientNonce + ServerNonce)`                      |
| Extraction of Session Keys | `ClientWriteMACKey, ServerWriteMACKey, ClientWriteKey, ServerWriteKey, ClientWriteIV, ServerWriteIV` |
| Finished Messages       | `FinishedMessage = PRF(MasterSecret, "finished", Hash(ClientHello + ServerHello))`                     |

## Detecting SSL Renegotiation Attacks

1. **Filter for Handshake Messages**: In Wireshark, use the following filter to view only handshake messages:
   ```plaintext
   ssl.record.content_type == 22
   ```

2. **Indicators of SSL Renegotiation Attacks**:
   - **Multiple Client Hellos**: Repeated Client Hello messages from a single client in a short timeframe signal an attack, as the attacker repeatedly triggers renegotiation to downgrade the cipher suite.
   - **Out of Order Handshake Messages**: Observing Client Hello messages after the handshake completion can indicate manipulation or attack.

### Reasons for SSL Renegotiation Attacks

- **Denial of Service**: Excessive renegotiation consumes server resources, potentially making it unresponsive.
- **Cipher Suite Exploitation**: Attackers may attempt renegotiation to exploit weak encryption configurations.
- **Cryptanalysis**: Renegotiation can facilitate cryptanalysis by helping attackers analyze SSL/TLS patterns, possibly exposing vulnerabilities.
