This module provides a foundational overview of malware analysis, aimed at enabling SOC analysts to perform essential malware analysis tasks, particularly focusing on Windows-based malware.

## Types of Malware

1. **Viruses**: Infect host files and spread by attaching to legitimate programs.
2. **Worms**: Self-replicating, spread autonomously over networks.
3. **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software, create backdoors for unauthorized access.
4. **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands ransom for decryption keys.
5. **Spyware**: Collects user data without consent, tracking activities or capturing credentials.
6. **Adware**: Displays intrusive ads and may collect browsing data.
7. **Botnets**: Networks of compromised devices used for attacks or malware distribution.
8. **Rootkits**: Gain control over OS components, concealing malicious activity.
9. **Backdoors/RATs**: Enable remote access and prolonged control of a compromised system.
10. **Droppers**: Carry additional malware payloads, ensuring stealthy installation.
11. **Information Stealers**: Focused on stealing sensitive data like passwords and PII.

## Malware Samples Resources

For malware research, handling samples should be done in secure, controlled environments. Notable sources include:
- **VirusShare**
- **Hybrid Analysis**
- **TheZoo (GitHub)**
- **Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net**
- **VirusTotal**
- **ANY.RUN**
- **Contagio Malware Dump**
- **VX Underground**

## Malware/Evidence Acquisition

During investigations, disk imaging and memory acquisition tools are vital. Recommended tools include:

### Disk Imaging Tools
- **FTK Imager**: Widely used for creating disk images.
- **OSFClone**: Open-source, supports multiple file systems.
- **DD/DCFLDD**: Command-line tools on Unix-based systems, with forensic-focused features.

### Memory Acquisition Tools
- **DumpIt**: Simple tool for memory dumps on Windows and Linux.
- **MemDump**: Command-line utility for RAM capture.
- **Belkasoft RAM Capturer**: Effective for Windows systems, even with anti-debugging.
- **Magnet RAM Capture**: User-friendly tool by Magnet Forensics.
- **LiME**: Linux Memory Extractor, effective for volatile memory acquisition.

### Additional Evidence Acquisition
- **KAPE**: Targeted artifact collection, quick analysis.
- **Velociraptor**: Host-based incident response tool using Velocidex Query Language (VQL).

## Malware Analysis: Definition, Purpose, & Techniques

**Malware Analysis** is the study of malware to understand its behavior, origin, and impact. This helps in detection, reverse engineering, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence gathering.

### Goals of Malware Analysis
- **Detection and Classification**: Identifying and categorizing malware to develop detection rules.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Disassembling code to understand functionality, encryption, and control infrastructure.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Observing malwareâ€™s interactions with systems (e.g., file changes, network connections).
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering attacker tactics, techniques, and malware origins.

### Common Malware Analysis Techniques

1. **Static Analysis**: Analyzing malware code without execution to gain initial insights.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Executing malware in a controlled environment to observe behavior.
3. **Code Analysis**: Reverse engineering code to understand structure and functionality.
4. **Memory Analysis**: Examining system memory to detect runtime modifications.
5. **Malware Unpacking**: Extracting hidden code from packed malware to reveal actual functions.
